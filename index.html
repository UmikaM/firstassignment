		<p>This article made me realize that technological viruses are a lot more common and reoccurring than biological viruses, but we as a general population do not realize this because it does not affect us on a physical level. The “information virus thesis” alludes to the idea that digital media can be used and manipulated by any user and put on the internet to the rest of the world, much like a biological virus. Susan Blackmore’s neo-Darwinian Meme Machine shows us that the media virus functions analogically and shows is that the pass on power could be man made, coded, and spread like a biological virus. Overall, this article explains the relation between biological and technological viruses and highlights an important perspective of just how much we are and will be affected by viruses in our day to day life, pre and post Covid-19.</p>
